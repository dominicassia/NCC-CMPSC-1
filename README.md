		Write a program that allows the user to enter the last names of five candidates in a local election
		and the number of votes received by each candidate. The program should then output each candidateâ€™s name,
		the number of votes received, and the percentage of the total votes received by the candidate.
		Your program should also output the winner of the election.

		A sample output is:
		Candidate			Votes Received		% of Total Votes
		Johnson 			5000 				25.91
		Miller 				4000 				20.73
		Duffy 				6000 				31.09
		Robinson 			2500 				12.95
		Ashtony 			1800				9.33
		Total				19300

		The Winner of the Election is Duffy.
